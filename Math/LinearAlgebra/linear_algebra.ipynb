    "\n",
    "A vector is a quantity that has both magnitude and direction. It is commonly represented as an array of numbers that define its components.\n",
    "A vector is an ordered list of numbers, often written as: $v = [v1, v2,... v3]$\n",
    "\n",
    "A Two Dimensional Vector (2D) has $x$ and $y$ components and Three Dimensional (3D) vector have $x$, $y$, $z$ components and dimension can get complicated it we working with multiple vectors and multiple components\n",

    "### Geometric Vectors\n",
    "\n",
    "A vector can be thought of as a directed line segment in space.\n",
    "In 2D, the vector $v=[3,4]$ can be visualized as an arrow starting at the origin (0,0) and ending at the point (3,4). like $x-axis$ and $y-axis$\n",

    "A polynomial vector is a representation of a polynomial as a row vector of coefficients. For example, the polynomial $x^{3}+2x^{2}-4x+3$ can be represented as the vector $[1,2,-4,3]$. it's like value of each vector\n",
